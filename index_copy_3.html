<!-- Intro to HTML & CSS I

  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->

      <p>
        Evolution or Evo for short is known to be the most difficult tournament
        of the year for fighting game players. It is a rare feat to win one of
        them, but Sonic has won six different events. Not only has it been
        multiple years he has won, but also multiple game titles.

      <h3>Different Ganes</h3>
      <p>
        Sonic has dominated the Fighting Game Community (FGC) since 2013 when he
        competed in MK9. He didn't win an evo that year, but he did take out the
        champ in that game in several other tournaments. His reign of terror
        started in the next game Injustice where he took home an evo
        championship for the first time in 2014. He went on to stay the champ in
        the next NRS title MKX. He was evo champ in 2015 and 2016. People in the
        FGC started to say he could only win in NRS titles, so he jumped to a
        different kind of game. Dragon Ball Fighterz the biggest game of 2018
        where he was still the unbeatable champ.
